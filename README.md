# CV Submission Brute-Force App

This project is a technical challenge solution designed to demonstrate problem-solving, backend automation, and secure file handling via a brute-force Basic Authentication attack followed by an automated file submission to a REST API.

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Summary

You are tasked with retrieving a temporary upload URL from a protected API using Basic Auth. However, the password is forgotten but known to be a permutation of `"password"`, with common substitutions (`a â†’ @`, `s â†’ 5`, `o â†’ 0`) and case variations.

Once the correct password is found, the application:

1. Retrieves the temporary upload URL.
2. Zips the following files:
   - `cv.pdf` â€” the applicant's rÃ©sumÃ©
   - `dict.txt` â€” the generated password permutations
   - `submissions/utils.py` â€” the Python source code
3. Encodes the ZIP file in Base64.
4. Submits the encoded ZIP along with applicant details to the provided upload URL via JSON.
